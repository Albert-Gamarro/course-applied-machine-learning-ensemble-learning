# Applied Machine Learning: Ensemble Learning (Personal Workspace)

This repository is my **personal workspace** for the LinkedIn Learning course
"Applied Machine Learning: Ensemble Learning" by Matt Harrison.  

All code, notes, and experiments are set up using my **own Conda environment** and 
Jupyter notebooks in **VSCode**, not the default Codespaces setup.
